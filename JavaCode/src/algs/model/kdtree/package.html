Defines the K-dimensional Tree and the optimized TwoDTree variation.

<h1>KD tree</h1>

A KD tree is a space-partitioning data structure to represent a collection of k-dimensional  
points. The structure offers efficient implementations of the following operations:
<ul>
<li> Nearest Point Query -- Which point in the KD tree is closest to a target point
<li> Range Query -- Which points in the KD tree are contained within an n-dimensional
                    Hypercube region.
</ul> 

To provide optimal behavior the KD trees should be balanced, however there is no efficient
means to rebalance trees. In fact, the KD tree implementation provided here offers no 
ability to remove an IMultiPoint once it has been inserted (you can remove all IMultiPoint
objects in the tree using the removeAll method). If you choose to dynamically add 
IMultiPoint objects to the tree, then the standard approach (much like hash tables in fact)
to rebalance the tree is to remove all IMultiPoints and insert them in an order that
ensures the resulting KD tree is balanced. The KDFactory class offers a static method
<code>public static synchronized KDTree generate (IMultiPoint []points)</code> to generate
a balanced KD tree using an algorithm that recursively locates medians and inserts the 
points "above" and "below" the median nodes as needed. The TwoDFactory class offers the
same functionality for TwoDTree.
