/**
 * Given a flow network (see definition below) with known capacities on 
 * each directed edge, compute the maximal flow between the source vertex
 * and the sink vertex.
 * 
 * <p>A Flow Network is a directed graph G=(V,E) with two special vertices,
 * source and sink. Each edge (u, v) has an associated capacity c(u,v) &ge; 0,
 * and the resulting computation leaves f(u,v) flow values with each edge.
 * Since it is likely that the problem data is stored in a rich set of classes,
 * this algorithm assumes that the multi-dimensional data needed by the algorithm
 * is provided up-front.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The structure of the data is as follows:</p>
 * 
 * Each edge (i,j) is represented by an EdgeInfo object containing:
 *    <ul><li>capacity: The capacity of the edge (or zero if that edge doesn't exist)
 *        <li>flow    : The current flow over the edge (or zero if no flow)
 *        <li>cost    : The cost per-unit for the commodity flowing over the edge (or zero if no cost)
 *        <li>start   : The start index i of the edge
 *        <li>end     : The end index j of the edge
 *    </ul>
 * Each vertex is represented by a VertexInfo object containing:
 *    <ul><li>previous:  The index of the previous vertex in the path
 *        <li>available: The amount of flow which can be transported from source
 *        <li>forward:   Is this vertex part of a forward edge or a backward edge
 *    </ul>
 * 
 * Note that available is the running total (regardless of path) as we 
 * compute along.
 * 
 * While the FlowNetwork and Search classes are parameterized, at this 
 * level of detail there is no need to know what its generic parameter is,
 * which is why we suppress warnings about generics.
