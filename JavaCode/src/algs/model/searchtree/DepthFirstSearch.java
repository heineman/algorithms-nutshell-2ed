/**
 * Given an initial state, a target goal state, expand in breadth-first
 * manner all available moves until the target goal state is reached.
 * <p>
 * This search approach uses a Stack to store the OPEN set, to expand the 
 * most recently added board states, until the depth limit is reached.
 * <p>
 * Note that different performance can be obtained by setting the closedStorage
 * appropriately. If set to {@link StateStorageFactory}.HASH then performance
 * benefits will be seen. If set to {@link StateStorageFactory}.TREEWITHKEY then
 * the boardstate Key will be used to differentiate boards. With board states that
 * exhibit rotational symmetry, this method will achieve faster search times.
