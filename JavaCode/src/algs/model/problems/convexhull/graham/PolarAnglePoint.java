/** 
 * A {@link PolarAnglePoint} object stores the original point and the polar angle when comparing the point against
 * a fixed point which has the lowest Y coordinate in a collection.
 * 
 * This extra storage simplifies {@link GrahamScan}. Note that the polar angle is initialized to {@link Double#MAX_VALUE}
 * so that computation only happens once, and thereafter is cached.
 * 
 * Attribute angle is computed and set externally, thus its field is not final; it remains package private to 
 * ensure integrity. It is set in lazy fashion from within {@link PolarSorter}.
 * 
 * The compareTo method is not invoked directly because GrahamScan algorithm uses {@link PolarSorter} as the 
 * comparator, which overrides the default {@link #compareTo(PolarAnglePoint)} method; however, it needs to be
 * here so the code properly compiles. Thus it never executes in the Graham Scan context.
