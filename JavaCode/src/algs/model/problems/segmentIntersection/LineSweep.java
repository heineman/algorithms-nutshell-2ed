/**
 * Contains LineSweep algorithm to detect all intersections among an array of
 * different line segments.
 * <p>
 * Note that the LineState uses an augmented binary tree in which the internal nodes
 * store (min, max) values that reflect the leftmost segment in the left sub-tree and 
 * the rightmost segment in the right sub-tree. The keys of the nodes in the tree are
 * the segments themselves.
 * <p>
 * As the algorithm progresses, there may be errors that occur because of problems
 * inherent in the floating point calculations. At times, the algorithm can actually
 * detect when these occur. The algorithm simply outputs the error to stderr but 
 * does not fail or throw an exception. This is an agreeable compromise given the
 * challenges in using floating point computations accurately.
 * <p>
 * The EventQueue is able to insert a new EventPoint in O (log n) as well as locate a
 * previous EventPoint in the event queue with the same performance.
 * <p>
 * This Algorithm assumes that the input contains no duplicate line segments. If 
 * duplicate segments exist, then some of the reported intersections may be a line
 * segment with itself (on both of its end-points).
