Defines core abstractions for generating visualizations to track the progress of
an algorithm.

The debugging interface(s) in this package are used to generate many of the 
images within the <i>Algorithms in a Nutshell</i> book published by
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com">O'Reilly Publishers</a>.
<p>
We use the <a href="http://www.graphviz.org">GraphViz</a> visualization package 
developed by AT&amp;T and freely released 
under the <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/License.php">Common Public License Version 1.0</a>.
This software provides a <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html">DOT</a>
language which can encode information about a graph to
be viewed by a tool known as <b>dotty</b>. This software has been ported from Unix
to Windows and many of the generated images in our book were produced by creating
a DOT source file to be used as input to <b>dotty</b>. While <b>dotty</b> supports
many forms of output, we chose to output postscript files which were then converted
to PDF using the Adobe Distiller utility.

<h1>DottyDebugger</h1>

The primary entry point for debugging is the 
<A HREF="../../algs/debug/DottyDebugger.html" title="class in algs.debug">DottyDebugger</A>
class.  This class implements the <A HREF="../../algs/debug/IDebugSearch.html" title="interface in algs.debug">IDebugSearch</A>
interface which powers the debugging.
<p>
We distribute the logic to the individual entities themselves, which simplifies
the drawing of debugging information at the expense of adding this extra method
to classes which otherwise should be unaware of the debugging infrastructure.
For example, the 
<A HREF="../../algs/model/problems/tictactoe/model/TicTacToeState.html" title="class in algs.model.problems.tictactoe.model">TicTacToeState</A>
class implements <A HREF="../../algs/debug/IGraphEntity.html#nodeLabel()" title="method in algs.debug.IGraphEntity">nodeLabel()</A>
as follows:
<p>

<pre>
public String nodeLabel() {
   // dotty requires column-ordered state, so we rotate information.
   StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
   for (int c = 0; c &lt;= TicTacToeBoard.MaxC; c++) {
      sb.append("{");
      for (int r = 0; r &lt;= TicTacToeBoard.MaxR; r++) {
         char val = board.get(c, r);
         if (val == TicTacToeBoard.EMPTY) {
            sb.append(" ");
         } else {
            sb.append (val);
         }

         if (r &lt;= TicTacToeBoard.MaxR-1) { sb.append ("|"); }
      }
      sb.append("}");
      if (c &lt;= TicTacToeBoard.MaxC-1) { sb.append ("|"); }
   }	
   return sb.toString();
}
</pre>

This method constructs a string of the form <code>"{O| |X}{ |X| }{O|X| }"</code> which
represents the state of the board in column-oriented format. All elements of the 
DOT language can be used within the implementation of nodeLabel(), which naturally
couples these classes with the specifics of the debugging infrastructure. It was 
decided to add this complication to each individual class since only the class knows
the full information that is to be used when visually drawing the node representing
that state within the debugging output.
